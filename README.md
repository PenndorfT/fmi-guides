# FMI Guides

[![Build Specification](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-guides/actions/workflows/build-guides.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-guides/actions/workflows/build-guides.yml)

This repository contains a number of  current prototype draft guides
for the current [Functional Mock-up Interface][FMI] 3.0 standard for
the exchange of simulation models, as well as upcoming layered
standards on top of it. Note that these drafts are being worked on
actively, and thus are subject to change without notice.

They are not normative, nor are they to be considered officially
endorsed by the Modelica Association or other involved organisations
prior to official adoption.

The [FMI 3.0 Implementer's Guide][guide] is currently maintained on
[GitHub][githubguide] and is published [here][guide]. It is based on
the [FMI][] standard.

The [FMI 2.0/3.0 Profiles][profile] are currently maintained on
[GitHub][githubprofile] and is published [here][profile].

In future additional guides might be integrated into this repository.

**NOTE**

The [FMI LS BUS Implementer's Guide][ls-bus-guide] has moved to
its own repository on [GitHub][github-ls-bus-guide] and is published
[there][ls-bus-guide].
